# Food Costs
'''
You're a bit all over the place as a college student. You used to eat out at expensive restaurants 
almost every day until your parents gave you a talking-to about being irresponsible. Now, you've got 
to control your eating and spending habits.

So, here's the plan: you'll stick to the college mess for your meals every day, except Sundays. On 
Sundays, you're treating yourself to those fancy restaurant meals.
The cost is Rs. X for the mess food each day, and Rs. Y for the restaurant splurges.

Now, what's the cost of food per week? Note that you don't have to pay for the mess on Sundays.
A week has seven days, as usual.

**Input Format**
The first and only line of input contains 2 space-separated integers, X and Y.

**Output Format**
Output a single integer: the weekly cost of food.

**Constraints**
1 ≤ X < Y ≤ 1000

**Sample 1:**
Input    --> Output
100 500  --> 1100
Explanation:
On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, your food cost is 100.
On Sunday, your food cost is 500.
Thus your total food cost is 100+100+100+100+100+100+500=1100
